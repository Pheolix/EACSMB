# EACSMB
A 3D city building game. Currently under construction.


It's written in pure C using no frameworks. Dependencies are Xlib, FreeType, libPNG, GLEW, and OpenGL 4.5. You should probably have a lot of ram as well as a real CPU.

Licensed under Affero GPL v3.0 until I get a stronger copyleft license for games.
