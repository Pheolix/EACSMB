process X expose event

png loading
text rendering
gui toolkit

object picking











LATER:

error reporting on max_events being insufficient, possibly somethign to dump the queue
clean up shader loading code








IDEAS:
--------------------
animated building demolitions
buildings should not change often, as in real life
day and night cycle
randomized building generator/customizer. swap out colors, fiddle with texture layering.
freeform park-as-a-zone, with auto layout generator
automatically generate residential yards and corporate parks
difficulty level multiplies water/electric usage, boosts crime, decreases economic demand
rain and clouds, should show in reflections
fog
destroyed buildings should fall into one another
fishing and hunting licenses
"football traffic"
tides
plant aspen and redwood as forest fire breaks
sieze forest lands and log for profit
